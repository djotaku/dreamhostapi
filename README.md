This package was spun out of my [DreamHost_DNS_Go](https://github.com/djotaku/dreamhost_dns_go) program so that it can be the basis of other small DreamHost utility programs. 

It currently supports the endpoints I need for my projects. I will accept issues or pull requests to add the listserve endpoints.
